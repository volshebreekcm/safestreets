## Overview

The Road Damage Detection and Management System is designed to optimize the workflow of road maintenance operations. Field workers can capture images of road damages via a mobile application, which are then automatically analyzed by a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to classify damage types and assess severity. The system generates comprehensive reports accessible through a web dashboard for administrators, enabling efficient monitoring and assignment of repair tasks.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Mobile Application**: For maintenance teams to capture and submit damage reports
2. **AI-Powered Damage Detection**: Using Vision Transformer (ViT) for image analysis
3. **Backend Server**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB for data processing and management
4. **Web Dashboard**: React + MUI for administrative monitoring and task management

## Features

### Mobile Application

- **Image Capture**: Take photos of road damages with mobile devices
- **GPS Tagging**: Automatic location tagging for each image
- **Damage Submission**: Secure transmission to backend server
- **Status Tracking**: View history and status of submitted reports
- **Offline Support**: Store images when offline, sync when connected

### AI-Powered Damage Detection

- **Image Classification**: Categorizes damages as potholes, surface cracks, alligator cracking, or erosion/wear
- **Severity Assessment**: Evaluates damage based on crack width, area size, and density
- **Text Summary Generation**: Creates concise damage reports with type, severity, priority, and recommended action
- **Performance Optimization**: Image preprocessing and confidence thresholds for improved accuracy

### Backend Server

- **Image API**: Handles reception, storage, and processing of uploaded images
- **ViT API Integration**: Communicates with ML model and processes responses
- **Database Management**: Stores and manages user data, images, classification results, and repair history
- **Email Automation**: Generates and sends detailed reports to administrators
- **Task Assignment API**: Enables admins to assign repair tasks to field teams

### Web Dashboard

- **Admin Login Panel**: Secure administrative access
- **Visual Reports**: Filtered view of reported damages
- **Map View**: Location-based heatmap of damage reports
- **Analytics & Insights**: Trends, severity distribution, and identification of problem areas
- **Repair Management**: Task assignment and status updates
- **Historical Analysis**: Review of past reports and repair patterns

### Notifications & Alerts

- **Email Alerts**: Automatic notifications for high-priority damages
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time alerts for field teams
- **Repair Reminders**: Deadline notifications for pending tasks

## Machine Learning Model

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model is trained on a diverse dataset of road damage images. It identifies and classifies damages with high accuracy.

### Damage Categories
- Potholes
- Surface cracks
- Alligator cracking
- Erosion/wear

### Severity Levels
- Low: Minimal impact on road usability
- Medium: Noticeable impact, but not urgent
- High: Significant impact, requires prompt attention
- Critical: Immediate safety hazard, urgent repair needed

## Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Input validation and sanitization
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and CORS policies
- **Image Storage**: Secure cloud storage with controlled access
